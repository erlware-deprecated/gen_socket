@title The gen_socket application
@doc 

<p>
gen_socket provides a non-blocking generic socket server that can be
used with TCP and UNIX domain sockets. The server is implemented as
an OTP supervisor tree. The main supervisor creates a listening server
that accepts incoming connections. A secondary supervisor creates and
manages user-provided processes for each accepted connection.
